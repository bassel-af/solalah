# Product Requirements Document — Solalah Platform

**Version**: 2.0
**Date**: 2026-03-23
**Status**: Draft
**Audience**: Human developers, AI coding assistants

---

## 0. Existing Codebase Context

This PRD describes the evolution of an **already-running** Next.js application. A fresh AI or developer must understand the current state before making changes.

**Current state of the app:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router) + React 19 + TypeScript, using `pnpm`
- Multi-family routing already exists: `/{familySlug}` (e.g., `/saeed`, `/al-dabbagh`)
- Family configs are statically defined in `src/config/families.ts` as a `FAMILIES` record with slugs, root IDs, and GEDCOM file paths
- GEDCOM files live in `/public/` and are fetched and parsed entirely in the browser
- GEDCOM parser lives at `src/lib/gedcom/parser.ts` — this must be preserved and reused as the import engine in Phase 3
- No authentication, no database, no backend — everything is client-side today
- The root URL (`/`) returns 404; all content is under `/{familySlug}`

**What Phase 1 changed:**
- Introduced a database (PostgreSQL via Supabase), an auth layer (Supabase Auth / GoTrue), and Next.js API routes as the backend
- The existing `/{familySlug}` routing evolved: slugs become workspace slugs stored in the database rather than static config
- Existing family configs in `src/config/families.ts` were seeded as workspace records in the database
- The existing tree visualization continues to read from static GEDCOM files until Phase 2 (no tree data migration in Phase 1)

**⚠️ Phase 1 cleanup required in Phase 2:**
Phase 1 created a Prisma schema with 20 tables, including branch-related tables (`branches`, `branch_memberships`, `branch_invitations`) and `branch_id` foreign keys on content tables (`posts`, `albums`, `events`). These must be **removed via a Prisma migration** at the start of Phase 2, as the branch model has been eliminated from the architecture (see Section 2.2). The notification types `branch_invite` and `branch_admin_vacancy` should also be removed.

**Tech stack:**
- Framework: Next.js 15 App Router
- Language: TypeScript (strict mode)
- Package manager: pnpm
- ORM: Prisma (manages `public.*` schema migrations against the Supabase PostgreSQL instance)
- API: Next.js API routes (`src/app/api/`)
- Auth: Supabase Auth (GoTrue), integrated via `@supabase/supabase-js`
- Database: PostgreSQL (provided by self-hosted Supabase)
- Deployment: Docker Compose (see §9)
- UI: CSS Modules + design tokens, RTL

## 1. Vision

Solalah is evolving from a read-only genealogy viewer into a **private family collaboration platform**. Each family gets a shared digital space (workspace) with a family tree, news, albums, and events. A single user account works across multiple family workspaces simultaneously.

Sub-families that want their own private content (news, albums, events, meetings) simply create their own independent workspace. Workspaces are never nested or dependent on each other. The only cross-workspace connection is at the **tree level**: a workspace can display a read-only pointer to a branch (subtree) from another workspace's family tree.

The platform is Arabic-first, RTL, and designed for families — not for general social networking. Privacy is a core value: private content must stay private, even from platform administrators.

---

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1 Workspace

A workspace represents a family (e.g., "آل سعيد" for an extended family, or "عائلة أحمد" for a nuclear family). It is the **only** organizational unit in the platform — there are no sub-groups, branches, or nested structures within a workspace.

- Any registered user can create a workspace (self-service)
- Has exactly one family tree shared by all members
- Has workspace-wide content visible to all members (news, events, albums)
- Has one or more admins and zero or more members
- Members join by invitation only — no self-registration into a workspace
- Workspaces are fully independent — no workspace owns, nests under, or depends on another workspace
- Storage quota: **5 GB per workspace** (media across all content types counts toward this limit). Quota is tracked and visible to admins but **not enforced in v1** — the platform is free during the growth phase. Enforcement and billing will be introduced in a future version. A policy page must exist from launch that can be updated when this changes.

### 2.2 No In-Workspace Branches

Earlier versions of this PRD defined "branches" as private sub-groups inside a workspace with their own content scope, roles, and permissions. **This model has been removed entirely.** The reasons:

- It created tight coupling between branch and parent workspace (deletion cascades, permission complexity)
- It required branch-specific roles, vacancy resolution logic, and scoped content queries — all unnecessary complexity
- The same goal (private space for a sub-family) is achieved more simply: the sub-family creates their own independent workspace

**What was removed:** `Branch`, `BranchMembership`, `BranchInvitation` tables; branch roles (`branch_admin`, `branch_member`); `branch_id` on content tables; branch-scoped content and permission checks; branch admin vacancy resolution logic.

**What replaces it:** Nothing at the workspace level. Sub-families that want private content create their own workspace. The only cross-workspace feature is branch pointers in the family tree (see Section 2.6).

### 2.3 User

A user is a single account that can participate in multiple workspaces.

- One account links a person's presence across all their workspaces
- Has independent roles in each workspace (e.g., admin in one, member in another)
- Can optionally be linked to an individual in each workspace's family tree (see Section 2.5)
- A user's entry in a workspace's family tree is independent of their entry in another workspace's tree (the trees are separate; cross-tree identity linking is deferred but the architecture must not prevent it)

### 2.4 Roles

**Workspace roles** (per workspace):

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `workspace_admin` | Manages workspace settings, members, and grants content roles. |
| `workspace_member` | Base role. Can view workspace-wide content. Additional capabilities are granted via content roles below. |

**Content roles** (granted per workspace member by `workspace_admin`):

| Role | Description |
|---|---|
| `tree_editor` | Can add, edit, and delete individuals and relationships in the workspace tree |
| `news_editor` | Can create and edit news posts |
| `album_editor` | Can create albums and upload media |
| `event_editor` | Can create and edit events |

A `workspace_admin` implicitly has all content roles.

### 2.5 User-Tree Linking

A user account can be linked to an individual record in a workspace's family tree. This is optional — a user can be a workspace member without being linked to any individual, and an individual in the tree can exist without a linked user account.

**Linking flows:**

- **Flow A (invite-with-link)**: When a `workspace_admin` invites a user to the workspace, they may optionally specify which individual in the tree this user corresponds to. The invitee must confirm the link when accepting the invitation. The link becomes active only after confirmation.
- **Flow B (member requests link)**: An existing workspace member can search the tree and request to be linked to a specific individual. The request is sent to the `workspace_admin` as a notification. The admin approves or rejects. The link becomes active only after admin approval. A member cannot self-link without admin approval.

**Rules:**
- One individual <-> at most one linked user account per workspace
- A user can be unlinked by themselves or by a `workspace_admin`
- Linking a user to an individual does not change any privacy or content access rules — it is a profile association only (used for personalization, birthday notifications, tree highlights, and future cross-workspace identity features)

### 2.6 Branch Pointers (Cross-Workspace Tree Sharing)

A branch pointer allows a workspace to display a **read-only reference** to a subtree (branch) from another workspace's family tree. This is the only cross-workspace mechanism in the platform — workspaces themselves have no knowledge of each other.

**How it works:**
- A "branch" in tree terms = an ancestor individual + all their descendants (goes downward only, never upward)
- The admin of workspace A (source) provides a shareable link for a branch in their tree
- A user in workspace B (target) adds that branch to their tree via the link — it appears as a read-only pointer
- The pointer reads live from the source: if workspace A edits an individual in the branch, workspace B sees the update automatically
- The pointer is read-only in workspace B — they cannot edit individuals that belong to workspace A's tree

**Admin controls on the source workspace:**
- **Shareable**: branches can be shared as pointers and can also be hard-copied by the target workspace
- **Copyable only**: branches cannot be shared as live pointers, but can be hard-copied (one-time import, no live link)
- **None**: branches cannot be shared or copied

**Lifecycle events:**
- If the source workspace **revokes sharing** for a branch, all pointers to that branch are automatically converted to deep copies in each target workspace. The target workspace admin receives a notification: "This branch is no longer maintained by the original workspace. It is now your own copy."
- If the source workspace **deletes the branch ancestor** (or the workspace itself is deleted), the same deep-copy conversion + notification occurs.
- If the target workspace wants to **edit** a pointed branch, they must first do a hard copy, which breaks the live link and creates an independent copy they fully own.

---

## 3. Content Model

Content objects (news posts, albums, events) belong to a **workspace** and are visible to all workspace members.

No content is public to the internet unless explicitly shared via a public link (a future feature, out of scope for now).

### 3.1 Content Types

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| News post | Rich text announcement or update, optional media attachments |
| Album | Collection of photos/videos |
| Event | Calendar entry with date, time, location, description, optional RSVP |

### 3.2 Media Limits

All uploaded media (images, videos) in news posts, albums, and events counts toward the workspace's **5 GB storage quota**.

### 3.3 Family Tree

The family tree belongs to the workspace and is shared by all workspace members. It is editable by users with the `tree_editor` role.

---

## 4. Permission Model (Summary)

| Action | Who can do it |
|---|---|
| Create a workspace | Any registered user (self-service) |
| Invite members to workspace | `workspace_admin` |
| Remove members from workspace | `workspace_admin` |
| Grant content roles | `workspace_admin` |
| Edit the family tree | Users with `tree_editor` role (or `workspace_admin`) |
| Link a user to a tree individual | `workspace_admin` approves; user confirms |
| Request self-linking to a tree individual | Any `workspace_member` (pending admin approval) |
| Create news/albums/events | Users with the corresponding editor role (or `workspace_admin`) |
| Share a branch pointer to another workspace | `workspace_admin` of source workspace (if sharing policy allows) |
| View RSVP responses for an event | Configurable by the event creator or `workspace_admin` (options: all members see full list, counts only, or admin-only) |

---

## 5. Feature Requirements

### 5.1 Authentication

- Handled by **Supabase Auth** (self-hosted via Docker Compose, see `docs/auth-provider-decisions.md`)
- JWT-based sessions with full refresh token control
- Workspace memberships are managed in the application layer, not in Supabase Auth
- Supabase Auth handles: login, registration, password recovery, email verification, session management, token revocation
- **Supported sign-in methods:**
  - Email + password
  - Google SSO (OAuth)
  - Phone number OTP via SMS (requires SMS gateway — deferred to a later phase, infrastructure is ready from day one)
- **2FA**: TOTP-based (authenticator app) supported natively
- All auth infrastructure runs in Docker on our own server — no user data leaves to third-party services

### 5.2 Workspace Management

- Workspace has: name (Arabic + Latin), slug (URL identifier), logo/avatar, description
- Any registered user can create a workspace; the creator becomes the first `workspace_admin`
- Workspace admin can: invite members, remove members, grant/revoke content roles, manage workspace settings, configure branch sharing policy
- Storage usage dashboard visible to `workspace_admin`

**Invite methods** (both supported):

- **Email invite**: admin enters a member's email -> invite link sent -> recipient clicks, signs in or registers, joins workspace
- **Workspace join code**: admin generates a short alphanumeric code (e.g., `SAEED-4X7K`). Admin shares it anywhere (WhatsApp group, SMS, verbally). Any signed-in user who enters a valid code joins the workspace. Codes can have an optional expiry date and an optional max-use count set by the admin. Admin can revoke a code at any time.

### 5.3 Editable Family Tree

- Tree data stored in the database (not as static GEDCOM files at runtime)
- GEDCOM is the import/export format, not the storage format
- The existing GEDCOM parser (`src/lib/gedcom/parser.ts`) is preserved and reused as the import engine
- Operations: add individual, edit individual, add relationship, remove relationship, delete individual
- Privacy flag on individuals (`isPrivate`) is preserved and enforced in the UI
- **Each workspace owns its own tree data** — no shared mutable references across workspaces
- Branch pointers (Section 2.6) allow read-only cross-workspace subtree references

### 5.4 GEDCOM Import/Export

- **Import**: workspace admin or `tree_editor` can upload a `.ged` file to populate or update the tree (reuses existing parser)
- **Export**: any workspace member can export the full tree as a `.ged` file at any time

### 5.5 Policy Page

- A `/policy` page must exist from launch containing: terms of service, privacy policy, and storage/billing policy
- Written in Arabic (primary) and English
- Must clearly state: the platform is currently free, but terms including storage limits and billing may change with notice
- The page is publicly accessible (no login required)
- Content is managed as a static document and updated manually when policies change

### 5.6 News

- Rich text posts with optional media attachments (counts toward storage quota)
- Workspace-scoped (visible to all workspace members)
- Members can react and comment (basic interactions, details TBD)
- Admin can pin posts

### 5.7 Albums

- Collections of photos and videos
- Workspace-scoped
- Photos can be tagged to individuals in the family tree
- Storage usage counted for admin visibility

### 5.8 Events / Calendar

- Events have: title, date/time, location (text), description, optional RSVP
- Workspace-scoped
- Birthdays and anniversaries from the family tree are auto-populated as workspace-level events (read-only, generated)
- Members can RSVP: attending / not attending / maybe
- RSVP visibility is configurable per event: full list / counts only / admin-only

---

## 6. Data Model (High-Level Entities)

### Schema ownership

All tables below live in the `public` schema and are managed by **Prisma** migrations. GoTrue manages the `auth` schema independently. Application code never queries `auth.*` directly.

When a user is created in GoTrue, a corresponding row is inserted into `public.users` (via a GoTrue webhook or database trigger) with the same UUID. All foreign key relationships in the application reference `public.users.id`, never `auth.users.id`. This keeps the application decoupled from the auth provider — switching auth providers means updating `public.users`, nothing else.

```
-- auth.users is owned by GoTrue (not shown here)
-- public.users mirrors it and is the only user table the app touches

public.users  <- mirror of auth.users, created on user sign-up

Notification
  id, user_id, type, payload (JSON), is_read, created_at
  (types include: workspace_invite, tree_link_request, tree_link_approved,
   branch_pointer_revoked)
```

**Tables removed from Phase 1 schema** (must be dropped via Prisma migration at start of Phase 2):
- `branches`
- `branch_memberships`
- `branch_invitations`
- `branch_id` column on `posts`, `albums`, `events`
- Notification types `branch_invite` and `branch_admin_vacancy`

## 7. Build Phases

### Phase 1 — Auth & Workspace Foundation ✅ COMPLETE

**✅ Infrastructure:**
- Supabase Auth self-hosted (Docker Compose): PostgreSQL + GoTrue v2.186.0 + Kong 3.9.1 + Studio + pg-meta — `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- Prisma ORM with full data model (20 tables) — `prisma/schema.prisma`, migration applied
- Prisma v7 with `@prisma/adapter-pg` driver adapter — `src/lib/db.ts`
- Supabase client libraries via `@supabase/ssr` — `src/lib/supabase/client.ts` (browser), `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` (server), `src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts` (middleware)
- Environment config — `.env.local` (Next.js), `docker/.env` (Docker Compose), `.env` (Prisma)
- Phone OTP infrastructure ready in GoTrue config but activation deferred (SMS gateway not configured)

**✅ Auth pages & middleware:**
- Auth pages — `/auth/signup`, `/auth/login` with email/password + Google OAuth button (Arabic RTL UI)
- Auth callback route — `/auth/callback` for OAuth/email confirmation redirects, sets auth cookies via `@supabase/ssr`
- User sync — `POST /api/auth/sync-user` mirrors GoTrue user to `public.users`, wired into login/signup/callback flows
- Shared sync helper — `src/lib/auth/sync-user.ts` (used by both API route and callback)
- Route protection middleware — `src/middleware.ts` uses `@supabase/ssr` to verify/refresh sessions, redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth/login`
- Auth utilities — `src/lib/api/auth.ts` (server-side `getAuthenticatedUser`), `src/lib/api/client.ts` (client-side `apiFetch` with auto Bearer token)
- Tests — middleware, sync-user API, sync-user helper, callback, auth helper, API client (23 tests)

**✅ Workspace features:**
- Workspace CRUD API — `POST /api/workspaces` (create), `GET /api/workspaces` (list), `GET /api/workspaces/[id]` (detail), `PATCH /api/workspaces/[id]` (update), `GET /api/workspaces/by-slug/[slug]` (slug resolution)
- Self-service workspace creation; creator becomes first `workspace_admin` (atomic via `$transaction`)
- Workspace membership API — `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/members` (list), `POST /api/workspaces/[id]/members` (invite by email with optional tree-link), `PATCH /api/workspaces/[id]/members/[userId]` (update role/permissions), `DELETE /api/workspaces/[id]/members/[userId]` (remove, last-admin protected)
- Join code API — `POST /api/workspaces/[id]/invitations/code` (generate code, e.g. `SAEED-4X7K`), `POST /api/workspaces/join` (join via code, validates expiry/max uses)
- Content roles: admin can grant `tree_editor`, `news_editor`, `album_editor`, `event_editor` via membership update
- Workspace auth guards — `src/lib/api/workspace-auth.ts` (`requireWorkspaceMember`, `requireWorkspaceAdmin`)
- Request validation via `zod`; BigInt serialization via `src/lib/api/serialize.ts`
- Dashboard UI — `/dashboard` (workspace list with "عائلة" prefix), `/dashboard/create` (create workspace form)
- Workspace detail page — `/workspaces/[slug]` (members list, invite modal, tree link if family config exists)
- Login/signup/callback redirect to `/dashboard`; root `/` redirects authenticated users to `/dashboard`
- Seed script — `prisma/seed.ts` migrates existing family configs to workspace records (excludes `test`)
- Storage quota tracked in schema (5 GB default) but not enforced
- Tests — workspaces, workspace detail, workspace members, workspace invitations, workspace by-slug (38 tests)

**✅ Email invites & Google OAuth:**
- Email invite sending — Nodemailer transport (`src/lib/email/transport.ts`) with Gmail SMTP, Arabic RTL email template (`src/lib/email/templates/invite.ts`)
- Invite acceptance flow — `/invite/[id]` server+client page, `POST /api/invitations/[id]/accept` with full validation (status, expiry, email match, already-member, race condition handling)
- Invitations set `expiresAt` (7 days) and `maxUses: 1`; acceptance is atomic via `$transaction`
- Google OAuth — configured in GoTrue (`docker/.env`), redirect URI via Kong, `?next` param forwarded through OAuth+signup flows
- Auth pages fixed — `useSearchParams` for SSR-safe `?next` param handling in login/signup
- Tests — invite email template (9 tests), invite acceptance API (12 tests)

**✅ Policy page:**
- Policy page — `/policy` (publicly accessible, Arabic primary + English, covers terms/privacy/billing)
- Clearly states platform is currently free; terms may change with notice

### Phase 2 — Editable Family Tree ✅ COMPLETE

**✅ Cleanup:**
- Removed branch-related tables from Prisma schema (`branches`, `branch_memberships`, `branch_invitations`) via migration
- Removed `branch_id` column from `posts`, `albums`, `events` tables
- Removed branch-related enums (`BranchRole`, `BranchInvitationStatus`) and all branch relations from User/Workspace models

**✅ Editable family tree:**
- Tree data stored in the database (individuals, families, family_children tables)
- CRUD API for individuals and relationships (`tree_editor` role or `workspace_admin`) — 8 endpoints: POST/PATCH/DELETE individuals, POST/PATCH/DELETE families, POST/DELETE family children
- `requireTreeEditor` auth guard enforces `tree_editor` permission or `workspace_admin` role
- Tree visualization reads from database via `GET /api/workspaces/[id]/tree` — DB records mapped to `GedcomData` shape so all existing visualization components work unchanged
- Privacy flag on individuals (`isPrivate`) preserved and enforced in the UI
- Each workspace owns its own tree data — no shared mutable references across workspaces
- `isDeceased` column added to preserve GEDCOM `DEAT` tag (deceased without date)
- All mutations logged to `TreeEditLog` for future audit trail (Phase 6)
- Workspace tree page at `/workspaces/[slug]/tree` with empty tree state, individual add/edit form, and edit controls in PersonDetail sidebar (edit, add child, add spouse, add parent, delete)
- Seed script extended to populate tree data from existing GEDCOM files
- 94 new tests (264 total)

We need also btw to make it possible in edit person UI to mark him as dead without putting dates. Also we need to add a way to add notes. Check if these things are also parsable from gedcom or not.

### Phase 3 — Family-Aware Relationship Editing

Phase 2 introduced basic tree editing, but the "Add child" flow has a gap: when a person has multiple families (e.g., a man with two wives, or a woman who remarried), the UI adds the child to the first family without asking the user which family/spouse the child belongs to. This must be fixed before the tree editor is usable for real polygamous family data.

**Family picker for add-child:**
- When a person has multiple `familiesAsSpouse`, the "Add child" action must show a picker asking which family (spouse) the child belongs to
- The picker displays the other spouse's name for each family (e.g., "أبناء من سارة" / "أبناء من هدى")
- If a family has no other spouse (single parent), show it as "عائلة بدون زوج/زوجة"
- If the person has only one family, skip the picker (current behavior)

**Family picker for add-parent:**
- When adding a parent to a person who already has a `familyAsChild` with one parent, the new parent is added to that existing family — no picker needed
- When adding a parent to a person with no `familyAsChild`, a new family is created — no picker needed
- When adding a parent to a person whose `familyAsChild` already has both husband and wife, show an error: "هذا الشخص لديه والدان بالفعل"

**Move child between families:**
- A tree editor can move a child from one family to another (remove from old family, add to new family)
- This handles corrections when a child was added to the wrong family

**Fix seed script — subtree-per-workspace seeding:**
- Currently, the seed script imports the entire GEDCOM file (all 551 individuals) into every workspace. This is wrong — each workspace should only contain its own family subtree.
- Each family config has a `rootId` — the topmost ancestor for that family. The seed script must:
  1. Parse the full GEDCOM file
  2. Starting from the family's `rootId`, walk downward: collect the root, their spouses, all descendants, and all descendants' spouses
  3. Only import this subtree into the workspace — not the entire file
  4. Import the corresponding Family and FamilyChild records for only those individuals
- This means each workspace gets a distinct, non-overlapping subset of the GEDCOM data (unless families share members via marriage, in which case both workspaces get their own copy of that person)

### Phase 4 — User-Tree Linking + Branch Pointers

**User-tree linking:**
- Flow A: invite-with-link (admin specifies individual at invite time, user confirms)
- Flow B: member requests link, admin approves/rejects with notification
- Link status displayed on member profiles within workspace

**Branch pointers:**
- Add `branch_sharing_policy` column to `workspaces` table
- Add `BranchPointer` table
- Admin configures workspace sharing policy (shareable / copyable_only / none)
- Admin can generate a shareable link for any branch (ancestor + all descendants downward)
- Target workspace adds the branch as a read-only pointer
- Pointer reads live from source — edits in source are visible automatically
- Revoke or source deletion triggers deep-copy conversion + notification to target admin
- Hard copy option: target can break the live link and get an independent editable copy

### Phase 5 — GEDCOM Import/Export

- **Import**: workspace admin or `tree_editor` can upload a `.ged` file to populate or update the tree
- Reuses the existing GEDCOM parser (`src/lib/gedcom/parser.ts`) as the import engine
- **Export**: any workspace member can export the full tree as a `.ged` file at any time
- Database -> generate `.ged` file -> download

### Phase 6 — Content

- News posts (workspace-scoped): rich text, media attachments, reactions, comments, pinning
- Albums (workspace-scoped): photo/video collections, tagging to individuals in the tree
- Events (workspace-scoped): calendar entries with RSVP, auto-generated birthdays/anniversaries from tree data
- Storage tracking and quota enforcement

### Phase 7 — Polish & Growth

- Audit log for all tree edits (TreeEditLog)
- Mobile app (Expo / React Native) — tracked separately
- Phone OTP sign-in activated (SMS gateway configured)
- Notifications (in-app + email)
- Public sharing links for specific content (opt-in)
- Cross-workspace identity linking: a lightweight link recognizing the same real person across workspaces — each workspace retains its own copy of the individual (no shared data, no sync). The link is informational only.

---

## 8. Out of Scope (for now)

- **Cross-workspace identity linking**: recognizing that an individual in workspace A and an individual in workspace B are the same real person. Each workspace owns its own copy of the individual — the link is informational only, no shared data or sync. The user account and `UserTreeLink` table already serve as the practical link. Full linking UI is deferred to Phase 6+. The data model must not prevent it.
- **Public workspace discovery**: workspaces are private and not discoverable
- **Real-time collaboration** (e.g., live cursors in tree editing)
- **Native mobile app**: tracked in a separate document

---

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements

- **RTL-first**: all UI is Arabic-first with RTL layout
- **Privacy by default**: no content is accessible beyond its declared scope, ever
- **Audit trail**: all tree edits are logged permanently (Phase 6)
- **Self-hosted**: no user data leaves the server to third-party services (excluding Umami analytics which is already in use)
- **Expandable architecture**: data model and API design must not block features listed as "out of scope for now"
- **Storage accountability**: every media upload is attributed to a workspace; quota is tracked from day one
- **Docker-based deployment**: the entire stack runs in Docker Compose on our own server. Phase 1 services: Next.js app, PostgreSQL, GoTrue (Supabase Auth). Storage API added in Phase 5. No managed cloud dependencies for core infrastructure.
