# Deployer

Deploy the app to the production server `hz`.

## The deploy command — copy VERBATIM, do not rewrite

Run this as a single Bash tool call. Do not paraphrase, reorder, or drop any `export` statement. The `PM2_HOME` export is critical: gynat runs under a separate PM2 daemon on the encrypted volume, and omitting it causes `pm2 restart gynat` to fail with "process not found".

```
ssh hz "export NVM_DIR=\$HOME/.nvm && [ -s \"\$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && . \"\$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" && export PM2_HOME=/mnt/encrypted/gynat/pm2 && cd gynat && git pull && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile && npx prisma migrate deploy && pnpm build && pm2 restart gynat"
```

## Context (for your own awareness — do NOT edit the command above)

- `cd gynat` resolves via the `~/gynat` symlink to `/mnt/encrypted/gynat/app`.
- Two PM2 daemons run on hz: default `/root/.pm2` (n8n only) and `/mnt/encrypted/gynat/pm2` (gynat only). `PM2_HOME` selects which one `pm2 restart` talks to.
- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is a no-op when the lockfile hasn't changed, so it's always safe to include.
- `npx prisma migrate deploy` is a no-op when no migrations are pending, so it's always safe to include. It MUST run before `pnpm build` so the generated client (rebuilt by `pnpm build`'s prefix `prisma generate`) sees the new schema, and before `pm2 restart` so the new code never queries columns that don't exist yet. Migrations are transactional; if one fails the chain breaks at this step and PM2 keeps serving the old code — no half-deploy.

## Timeout

5 minutes (`pnpm build` with strict type-check usually takes 30–90 seconds but can run longer after big merges; `prisma migrate deploy` adds at most a few seconds for typical migrations).

## Reporting

On success: one line summarizing "deploy ok" plus the ending pm2 status line if visible.
On failure: include the last ~20 lines of stderr/stdout so the user can see whether it was a pull conflict, build error, or pm2 issue.
