This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository ("solalah") contains a family genealogy project. The primary data is stored in a GEDCOM file (`saeed-family.ged`), which is a standard genealogy data format containing family tree information including individuals, relationships, births, deaths, and locations. The project is designed to support multiple languages, primarily Arabic and English.

## Package Management

This project uses **pnpm** as the package manager (version 10.28.0).

- Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
- The project currently has a minimal `package.json` with no dependencies yet

## File Structure

- `saeed-family.ged` - GEDCOM 5.5.1 format genealogy data file (generated by MacFamilyTree 11.2.1)
  - Contains individual records (INDI), family records (FAMS/FAMC), dates, places, and relationships
  - Text encoding: UTF-8
  - Large file (~285KB) with extensive family tree data

## GEDCOM File Format

The `.ged` file follows the GEDCOM standard:
- Hierarchical structure with level numbers (0, 1, 2, etc.)
- Records identified by tags like `INDI` (individual), `FAM` (family), `BIRT` (birth), `DEAT` (death)
- Cross-references use `@ID@` format (e.g., `@28283063@`)
- Dates and places are structured with specific tags and formatting
