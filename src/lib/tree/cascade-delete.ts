/**
 * Compute the set of individuals that would become unreachable if `targetId`
 * were deleted from the tree.
 *
 * Algorithm:
 * 1. Simulate removing `targetId` (exclude from individuals)
 * 2. Find ALL root ancestors in the ORIGINAL data (people with no `familyAsChild`),
 *    excluding the target
 * 3. From each root, BFS collecting all reachable people using ONLY downward
 *    (parent→child) and across (spouse) traversal — NO upward traversal
 * 4. Anyone remaining who is NOT reachable = affected
 *
 * WHY NO UPWARD TRAVERSAL: A married-in spouse has no `familyAsChild`, so they
 * appear as a root candidate. If we seed from them AND traverse upward from
 * children to parents, the married-in spouse would always be reached through
 * their children (who point to the shared family). This defeats the purpose of
 * detecting that the married-in spouse loses their connection when the linking
 * spouse is deleted.
 *
 * By only traversing DOWN and ACROSS:
 * - A real lineage root reaches all descendants and their spouses
 * - A married-in spouse is reached ONLY via a spouse link from a reachable
 *   lineage member — if that member (the target) is deleted, the married-in
 *   spouse is never reached, correctly marking them as affected
 * - A married-in spouse who IS a root candidate seeds BFS downward to shared
 *   children, but those children are ALSO reached from the real lineage root.
 *   The married-in spouse is only reached if another reachable person is their
 *   spouse (via ACROSS traversal). If their only spouse is the target, they
 *   remain unreached despite being a seed — wait, they ARE a seed, so they're
 *   in the reachable set...
 *
 * CORRECTION: We cannot simply seed from all root candidates, because the
 * married-in spouse would seed themselves into the reachable set. Instead:
 *
 * FINAL ALGORITHM (correct):
 * 1. Seed BFS from ALL root candidates (no familyAsChild, not target)
 * 2. BFS traverses ONLY DOWNWARD (parent→child) — no spouse, no upward
 * 3. This gives us the "lineage reachable" set
 * 4. Then expand: for each person in the lineage set, add their spouses
 *    (if not target and not already reachable). For each newly added spouse,
 *    also BFS downward from them. Repeat until stable.
 * 5. This ensures married-in spouses are only reachable if a lineage member
 *    (who survived the deletion) is married to them.
 *
 * Note: upward traversal (child→parent) is not needed because all parents
 * who are part of the lineage have no familyAsChild (they're roots) and are
 * already seeded. Intermediate parents have familyAsChild set, so they're
 * reached via their own parent's downward traversal.
